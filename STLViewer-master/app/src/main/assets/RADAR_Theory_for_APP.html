<span style="font-weight: bold;">RADAR Basic Theory:</span><br>
<br>
Since
the discovery of the existence of the electromagnetic wave, many
applications have been developed to solve different types of problems.
Radio Detection And Ranging have been one of the most popular of them,
using waves at microwave frequencies. With it, the position and speed
of an object can be detected even if it is not visible to the naked
eye. With RADAR, objects can be detected from thousands of kilometers
(depending on the medium and power levels), even through rain or fog.
This technology was adapted very fast for military purposes during
WWII, playing a key factor on the course of events. Its working
principle is fairly simple: A microwave source generates a pulse that
is emitted through an antenna, travels through the medium (commonly
air), reflected (echo) from an object, and received back (Figure 1).
From the echo time delay it is possible to compute the object&#8217;s
distance from the source, and from the frequency shift, the speed of it
can be also calculated. The basic equations that describe this
phenomenon are [1]:<br>

Where
St&nbsp; is the magnitude of the transmitted poynting vector (power
per
unit area) at a distance R. Pt is the transmitted power and G is the
gain of the transmit antenna. Part of this energy will bounce back from
the object (scattered power Ps) and then received by the RADAR system.
The ratio on between the transmitted power density St, and the
scattered power Ps is called<span style="font-weight: bold;">
Radar Cross Section (RCS) or &#963;</span>
[1]. This parameter has the units of area, and its value will depend of
the size, shape, and the material properties of the object. It also
will change with different wave incidence angle.<br>

Now,
the reflected power will decay following the Friis transmission
equation, having at the receiver antenna port the following spatial
power density (Sr)&nbsp; [1]:<br>

</div>
The
famous RADAR equation can be found by calculating the received power by
using the previous equation and the effective antenna aperture [1]:<br>

</div>
From
this equation it can be concluded that for a given minimum received
power (Pr) the detection range is function of the transmit power and
antenna, the RCS of the object, and the operating frequency. The main
types of Radar are: monostatic and bistatic. In the Monostatic system,
the transmit antenna is the same receive antenna. For the bistatic
case, two different antennas are use, one to transmit and a second one
to receive. Although the RCS value is function of the position of the
antennas, the phenomenon and the basic relationships are the same. <br>
<br>
Other
important basic aspects of radar are the pulse repetition frequency
(PRF) and the pulse width. The pulse with will determine the minimum
resolution while detecting multiple objects. If the objects are close
to each other and the pulse width is too long, then the echoes can
overlap, giving the reading of one large object, rather than two small
objects. Figure 2 illustrates this phenomenon [2]. On the other hand,
the PRF determines the maximum radar range. For instance, for a given
pulse, its echo is expected to be received before the next pulse is
emitted. In the case that the first echo is received after the second
pulse is transmitted, then it will not be possible to now if it
corresponds to the first or the second echo. This is the reason why the
PRF has to be selected accordingly with the expected maximum read
range. The speed of the object can also be resolved by determining the
frequency shift of the received echo, when compared with the
transmitted pulse. This shift is generated by the Doppler effect.<br>

and the key elements on a RADAR circuit, respectively [2].<br>

Different
techniques and methods are used to improve the system&#8217;s performance.
For example, with pulse frequency modulation (FM) and a filter with a
significant group delay at the receiver; the resolution can be improved
by pulse compression. Nowadays, in the military field, Electronic
Intelligence (ELINT) and Electronic Warfare (EW) technologies are being
applied to RADAR systems.&nbsp; For example, ELINT can be applied
to
analyze the RADAR signal being generated from an object, and detect the
nature of the platform attached to it. If the object is generating a
fast PRF, it might indicate that is a short range missile&#8217;s terminal
scanning, while a slow PRF can be a sign of the presence of a long
range system of a ship [2]. Moreover, many other applications are being
developed in the area of human vital signs monitoring. It had been
demonstrated that it is possible to use RADAR to detect respiratory and
cardiac frequencies, as well as voice from detecting the movement of
the throat.<br>
<br>
Since its definition during the 1940&#8217;s, Radar is a
technology that involves microwave circuits, antennas, and deep
understanding of the electromagnetic waves behavior in presence of
different mediums and objects. This technology will still be paramount
for microwave engineer for a long time, with many applications being
continuously developed.<br>
