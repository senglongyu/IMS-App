<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;">Since the discovery of the
existence of the electromagnetic wave, many applications have been developed to
solve different types of problems. Radio Detection And Ranging have been one of
the most popular of them, using waves at microwave frequencies. With it, the
position and speed of an object can be detected even if it is not visible to
the naked eye. With RADAR, objects can be detected from thousands of
kilometers, even through rain or fog. This technology was adapted very fast for
military purposes during WWII, playing a key factor on the course of events.
Its working principle is fairly simple: A microwave source generates a pulse
that is emitted through an antenna, travels through the medium (commonly air),
reflected (echo) from and electrically conductive object, and received back
(Figure 1). From the echo time delay It is possible to compute the object&#8217;s
distance from the source, and from the frequency shift, the speed of it can be
also calculated. The basic equations that describe this phenomena are [pozar]:</p><div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 377px; height: 265px;" alt="Radar_1" src="file:///C:/Users/Eduardo/Desktop/Radar_1.png"></div><p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align: justify;"><o:p></o:p></p></body></html>
